## Code Rules

### Verified as working

All code contributed to this repository should be verified as working, meaning you've tested the
functionality at least once and didn't encounter unexpected behaviour.

### Code Style

#### General

We request that all texture submissions be nested in a folder with the name of the ore you are submitting

```
RP/textures/blocks/"ore_name"/deepslate_"ore_name"
RP/textures/blocks/"ore_name"/"ore_name"
```

Same with items

```
RP/textures/items/"ore_name"/"ore_name"_chunk
```

#### Names

All identifier names should be in the vanilla style and use the namespace **ore-uni:**.

```
"ore-uni:deepslate_"ore_name"
"ore-uni:"ore_name"
```
