# Contributing

Thank you for considering to contribute to the **"MCBE-Unified-Ore"** project!

## Starting development

We strongly recommend **"bridge."** to edit the project files as their are presets avilable and a compiler built in to test out the addon in game.

## Presets

With Bridge v2 presets we are able to automate the entire coding process, with a few clicks you can easily create an ore that is semi-customizable and follows the guidelines of the pack! Loot Tables follow a heirarchy, if you select Iron then Iron and better will be able to mine the block! Our presets are constantly evolving be sure to see the new features!

## Code Rules

Please be sure to put your name at the top of any code you create so we are able to track who has made what, if you are using the presets this is automatically done for you.

### Verified as working

All code contributed to this repository should be verified as working, meaning you've tested the
functionality at least once and didn't encounter unexpected behaviour.

### Code Style

#### General

We request that all texture/file submissions be nested in a folder with the name of the ore you are submitting.
